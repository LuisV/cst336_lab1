          <p>I'm a first generation university student from a low income background.
          Despite my disadvantages, I have pushed myself forward throughout my academic career.
          I'm a friendly, helpful programmer who is passionate about building new things using computer science. 
          My greatest motivation in undertaking projects is creating things for people to better enjoy their time 
          spent on their devices and improve their productivity.</p>

          <p>I am currently part of the CSin3 program at California State University, Monterrey Bay. 
          The program is an intensive computer science bachelor's degree program at California State University
          - Monterey Bay, where each participant receives their Computer Science bachelor's degree within three years.  
          I have experience in full stack development as well as software development and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>When, I'm not working on assignments or projects, I like to unwind by playing the guitar
          and then enjoy a few indie video games on the side. I'm really interested in video game development, 
          but I don't have much experience yet.</p>
